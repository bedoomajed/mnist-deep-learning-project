📘 MNIST Deep Learning Project — README

🔍 Overview

This project applies deep learning techniques on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset using TensorFlow/Keras. It consists of 10 analytical and experimental tasks, including prediction analysis, regularization, optimization, activation comparisons, and model behavior investigation.

The project is structured into:

Notebook for running code (notebook.ipynb)

results/ folder containing generated predictions, loss curves, and optimizer comparisons

submission/ folder including detailed written reports for each task
